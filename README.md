# opentok-secure-appointments

Sample code for building a secure video appointments application

This repository has two parts - a NodeJS Express Server and a Vue Web Application, here you can find per-project information:

1. [Server](./server/README.md)
2. [Web Application](./client/README.md)

_NOTE_: This application is a great starting point for building your solution, and on top of it you should be able able to add your own business logic and features.

## User Story

Assume a healthcare use case of this project, where we would have the following roles:

1. A patient
2. A doctor
3. A clinician.

The clinician would schedule appointments between the doctor and the patient, and provide both of them with appropriate URLs to join a video call.

### Scheduling Appointments

As the clinician, your entry point should be `https://SERVER_ADDRESS/booking` (where SERVER_ADDRESS is where you deployed the Express application). This is the page that allows you to schedule appointments and view the list of previously scheduled appointments.

Upon scheduling an appointment you could also send an SMS with the link to a number, for example, the to the patient. You can also just click 'copy link' form the table of appointments.

Please note that every appointment has two links assigned to it - the HostURL and the GuestURL. In our healthcare use case for instance, the HostURL will be sent to the doctor and the GuestURL will be sent to the patient. You might decide to implement some logic that allows different privileges with each role.

</div>

### Joining a Video call

After successfully scheduling an appointment, both sides of the call can use the link to join the appointment. We've made it easy to implement a logic that enforces a time frame for the appointment (but you can decide to change it or even omit it using [env variables](./README.md#app-behavior)).

When the time arrives, both parties join the appointment and communicate over Video. We've added the option to mute, unpublish video and share your screen.

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="./client/src/assets/img/videocall.png" alt="drawing" width="700" align-self="center"/>
</div>
